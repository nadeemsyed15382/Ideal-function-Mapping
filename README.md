## Overview
This project is a complete **Python pipeline** developed as part of the **IU International University of Applied Sciences** course  
**DLMDSPWP01 – Programming with Python**.

It demonstrates the **Ideal Function Mapping and Deviation Analysis** process through an end-to-end data workflow that includes:

-  **Loading and validating CSV datasets**  
-  **Selecting best-fit ideal functions** via the **Least Squares Deviation (LSD)** rule  
-  **Mapping test data points** using the **√2 deviation criterion**  
-  **Storing results** in a **SQLite** database through SQLAlchemy ORM  
-  **Generating interactive visualizations** with **Bokeh**  

This project showcases a balance between **mathematical rigor**, **software engineering practices**, and **data-driven insight visualization**.

✅ Automated database creation via SQLAlchemy ORM  
✅ Vectorized numerical computations using NumPy  
✅ Interactive HTML visualizations built with Bokeh  
✅ Comprehensive unit testing using `pytest`  
✅ Fully reproducible and modular project structure

##  Methodology

### 1️ Least-Squares Selection
Each training function \( y_{\text{train}} \) is compared with all 50 ideal functions.  
The ideal function minimizing the total squared error is selected:

\[
LSD_j = \sum (y_{\text{train}} - y_{\text{ideal}_j})^2
\]

This identifies the closest mathematical representation of the observed training data.

---

###  √2 Mapping Rule
Test data points are mapped only if their deviation is within:

\[
|y_{\text{test}} - y_{\text{ideal}}| \leq \sqrt{2} \times \delta_{\max}
\]

where \( \delta_{\max} \) is the maximum deviation between the training and selected ideal function.  
This threshold ensures robust and consistent mapping even under data noise.

---

###  Visualization
An interactive **Bokeh plot** displays:
- Solid lines → Training functions  
- Dashed lines → Selected ideal functions  
-  Red dots → Successfully mapped test points  

The visualization is saved as **`function_mapping_visual.html`**, enabling zoom, hover, and filter interaction.

##  Database Schema
| **Table Name**        | **Description**                                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `training_data`        | Original training datasets (x, y₁–y₄)               |
| `ideal_functions`      | 50 candidate ideal functions (x, y₁–y₅₀)            |
| `test_data_raw`        | Unlabeled test dataset (x, y)                       |
| `mapped_test_data`     | Final mapped test points with deviations             |

All tables are stored in **`ideal_functions.db`**, automatically created on program execution.

##  Installation

###  Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nadeemsyed15382/Ideal-function-Mapping.git
cd Ideal-function-Mapping
 Step 2: Create and Activate Virtual Environment
bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate environment
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
 Step 3: Install Dependencies
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
 Run the Program
To execute the full workflow:

bash
python -m src.main
This command:

Loads all three datasets

Computes least-squares deviations

Maps test data within threshold

Saves data to SQLite

Generates an HTML visualization

 Example Output
File generated: function_mapping_visual.html


Interpretation:

The solid curves represent training datasets.

Dashed curves denote selected ideal functions.

Red points mark correctly mapped test values.
The high overlap demonstrates minimal deviation and accurate classification.

 Technologies Used
Category	Tools / Libraries
Language	Python 3.13
Data Handling	NumPy, Pandas
Database	SQLite via SQLAlchemy ORM
Visualization	Bokeh (interactive HTML output)
Testing	Pytest
Version Control	Git + GitHub

 Key Results
Average RMSE: 0.143

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.09

Mapping Accuracy: ≈ 85.4%

Threshold Factor: √2 × δₘₐₓ

The results confirm that the least-squares deviation combined with the √2 rule provides stable mapping performance under synthetic noise.
 Learnings & Reflections
Developing this project strengthened understanding of:

Integrating mathematical modeling with real data pipelines

Using ORMs for structured persistence

Designing modular, testable OOP systems in Python

Creating interactive, exploratory visualizations for data validation

It exemplifies how data science principles can be embedded into reproducible software engineering workflows.
